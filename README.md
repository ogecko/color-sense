Make sense of the colors in a scene, picture or image using Color Sense. 

This app uncovers the dimensions of colour, light and edge perception. It is designed for realist painters using watercolor, traditional or digital media. 

## Selecting Images
You can import images from your Desktop, Camera, Smartphone or Tablet. On a Tablet or Smartphone, Select Image will allow you to choose an image from your Gallery or to take a picture with your camera. On the Desktop you can drag files from File Explorer into the application or Select Image will bring up a File Open Dialog box.

## Reviewing Images
Pan and zoom into an image fluidly showing all tones and colors. You can zoom into the image using the mouse wheel, menu item or using pinch on a touch device. You can also lock the position of the view using the padlock on the menubar to prevent accidentally panning the image with touch gestures while tracing on a tablet.

## Color Space
Tap on a region to get a readout of a particular color, its HSL values and other colors with the same hue. Mark a region and you can get see where the colors are located in HSL space. You can also add labels for the pigment colors you have in your palette. On a Desktop Mouse 1 rotates the HSL color space, Mouse 2 pans the color space and the Mouse Wheel zooms into the color space. On a Touch device, One Finger Drag rotates the HSL color space, Three Finger drag pans the color space and Pinch zooms the color space.

To see how well the image reads without color, uncheck Show Colors and zoom out. All Chroma and Hue are removed from the image and only the tone is shown.

## Mask Dark Levels
Select levels 1, 2, upwards to mask the dark levels. This allows you to paint the light tones first, ignoring any dark glazes that will be added in later.

## Mask Light Levels
Select the upper levels to mask the light tones. Leave at least two tones visible to see an edge. This can help when painting the darker tones as it removes the detail in the light tones.
